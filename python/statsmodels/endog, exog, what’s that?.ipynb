    "\n",
    "In econometrics and statistics the terms are defined more formally, and different definitions of exogeneity (weak, strong, strict) are used depending on the model. The usage in statsmodels as variable names cannot always be interpreted in a formal sense, but tries to follow the same principle.\n",

    "However, to have a statistical model we need additional assumptions on the properties of the explanatory variables, x, and the noise. One standard assumption for many basic models is that x is not correlated with the noise. In a more general definition, x being exogenous means that we do not have to consider how the explanatory variables in x were generated, whether by design or by random draws from some underlying distribution, when we want to estimate the effect or impact that x has on y, or test a hypothesis about this effect.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is up to the user to know (or to consult a text book to find out) what the underlying statistical assumptions for the models are. As an example, exog in OLS can have lagged dependent variables if the error or noise term is independently distributed over time (or uncorrelated over time). However, if the error terms are autocorrelated, then OLS does not have good statistical properties (is inconsistent) and the correct model will be ARMAX. statsmodels has functions for regression diagnostics to test whether some of the assumptions are justified or not."
