/* Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector 
   to another. It helps keep your Sass very DRY. A placeholder class (start 
   with %) is a special type of class that only prints when it is extended, 
   and can help keep your compiled CSS neat and clean. */

// This CSS won't print because %equal-heights is never extended.
%equal-heights {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

// This CSS will print because %message-shared is extended.
%message-shared {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    padding: 10px;
    color: #333;

/* Note: Sass will combine the selectors instead
